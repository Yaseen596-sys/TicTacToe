# Project Roadmap

I explored a Python Tic-Tac-Toe project by Aqeel Anwar - https://github.com/aqeelanwar/Tic-Tac-Toe.

It runs successfully and uses functions to manage the board and moves.

My plan is to build on these ideas and add my own features and improvements.

Planned Features / Tasks

 Core Setup
 Clone original Tic-Tac-Toe repo and run it locally.
 Create initial project structure in our course GitHub organization.
Clean up code comments and remove unused code.

Game Improvements
  Add **input validation** (reject invalid positions, already-taken spots, non-numeric input).
  Add **replay option** (play again without restarting the program).
 Improve **win/draw detection messages** to be more user-friendly.
 Add **score tracking** across multiple rounds in the same session.

 User Experience (UX)
Clear instructions at the start (how to play, how to enter moves).
 Highlight whose turn it is (Player X vs Player O).
Add an option to **quit** gracefully from the main menu.

### Code Quality
 [ ] Refactor repeated code into reusable functions.
[ ] Add docstrings to main functions (e.g., `print_board`, `check_winner`, `play_game`).
 Add simple test cases (manual or unit tests) for key functions.

### Documentation
 Update `README.md` with:
How to run the game.
Description of features I added.
<!-- Example screenshots (if possible). -->
 Keep this `projectroadmap.md` updated with progress (check off items and add DONE notes).
