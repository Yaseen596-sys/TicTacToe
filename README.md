# TicTacToe

This is my Tic-Tac-Toe project.

## What to Know

A simple two-player game where players take turns marking **X** and **O** on a 3×3 board.

The first player to get three in a row:
- horizontally,
- vertically, or
- diagonally

wins the game. If all 9 spaces are filled and nobody has three in a row, the game is a **draw**.
